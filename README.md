## 🧠 Project Overview  
The **AI-Enabled Conversational IVR Modernization Framework** transforms the traditional Indian Railways IVR into an **intelligent, voice-driven conversational system**.  
Passengers can speak naturally, and the system automatically understands their request, processes it, and responds instantly.

### Supported Services  
- 🎟️ PNR Status Inquiry  
- 📝 Complaint Registration  
- 🚨 Emergency Assistance  
- 🕓 Train Schedule Inquiry  
- 💺 Seat Availability Check  
- 💰 Refund Status Tracking  

Built using **FastAPI**, integrated with **Twilio Voice API**, and powered by a **SQLite database**, the system delivers a faster and more user-friendly IVR experience.

## 🚀 Key Features  
- Fully **speech-enabled** IVR system  
- Automatic speech-to-text transcription (Twilio)  
- Smart **intent detection** and routing  
- Modular API structure  
- Real-time voice responses using **TwiML**  
- SQLite-backed complaint, refund, and PNR handling  
- **Cloud-hosted** on Render  
- Secure environment variable management (`.env`)

## 🏗️ System Architecture  

### 1. Incoming Call  
Caller contacts the Twilio number, and Twilio processes audio + transcription.
## 2. Twilio → FastAPI (Render URL)  
The webhook routes the call to:  

https://ai-enabled-conversational-ivr-69hh.onrender.com/voice/incoming

### 3. Speech Processing  
Twilio sends the transcribed text to `/process_speech`.

### 4. Intent Detection  
FastAPI extracts the user's intent (PNR, complaint, refund, etc.).

### 5. Dynamic Routing  
Each intent is handled by dedicated modules like:  
- `/pnr_status`  
- `/complaints`  
- `/refunds`  
- `/emergency`  
- `/train_schedule`  
- `/seat_availability`  

### 6. Voice Response  
FastAPI generates TwiML, Twilio speaks the response.

### 7. Database Storage  
SQLite stores complaints, PNR records (demo data), and refund info.
