## Project Overview

The **AI-Enabled Conversational IVR Modernization Framework** is designed to modernize traditional IVR (Interactive Voice Response) systems using AI and cloud technologies. Traditional IVR systems are often rigid, menu-driven, and frustrating for users. This project introduces a smarter, more flexible solution that allows businesses to handle voice calls with **AI-driven conversation flows**.

Key goals of this project:  

1. **Intelligent Voice Interaction**  
   Using Twilio Voice API and optional AI/NLP models, the system can handle voice calls intelligently, respond to queries, and provide information dynamically instead of following a fixed menu tree.

2. **Modular & Scalable Architecture**  
   The system is built on FastAPI with modular route structures (`/twilio/voice`, `/pnr_status`, `/complaints`, etc.) so it can easily scale and integrate additional features.

3. **Real-time Communication**  
   Incoming calls to a Twilio phone number trigger webhooks to the FastAPI server. The server processes the request and responds with dynamic instructions (e.g., what the caller hears or how the IVR responds).

4. **Local Development with Public Access**  
   Ngrok integration allows developers to expose their local FastAPI server as a public HTTPS endpoint for testing with Twilio webhooks without deploying to a cloud server.

5. **AI/NLP Integration (Optional)**  
   Future improvements can include AI-based intent recognition to provide conversational responses, automate common tasks (PNR status, complaints handling, etc.), and reduce human intervention.

**Use Cases:**  

- Railway or transport services for automated ticket inquiry (PNR status)  
- Customer support systems for complaints or inquiries  
- Any business that wants to modernize voice-based IVR systems with AI  

**Outcome:**  
The final system allows users to call a Twilio number and interact with a smart, AI-driven IVR that can handle voice commands dynamically, providing a modern alternative to traditional IVR menus.
